	<p align="center" id="back"> I grew up in the dusty farmlands of the Eastern Cape,born in a family of 5,my parents sacrificed everything so I could get a decent-good education. I left for Kzn when I was in grade 8 to finish my High school at Durban high school for boys.I stayed six more years in the Zulu Kingdom completing my tertiary studies at Ukzn(Bsc Psychology).Im in Johannesburg now and Im enjoying it here.I love learning and like a sponge consumes water,I consume knowledge easily.Iv learnt alot from traveling and sharing in different cultures</p>

	<center><p id="inter">Interests : </p></center>
	
	<p align="center" id="love"> I love sport and gardening, this is because i work on so many creative briefs that when I do find time to relax,I want to spend it doing something outside of the creative field.However as a creative nothing gives me more joy then writing, photography and oming up with ideas to solve problems.i am also a family guy,I spend most of my time with them catching up and doing cool things together.</p>
	
	<p align="center" id="sound" >Music :</p>

	<P align="center" id="wise"> uNduduzo makhathini once told me that "to be a pianist is to also be a healer".This resonated with me because music for me is a way of healing the self and the other.So i want to heal with what ever sound I produce.My grandfather was a Jazz pianist and I am a drummer currently learning keys,I enjoy this journey and hopefully, soon, when I am  close towards the end of my journey,I can share it with you. Mixing and Djing are also things i"m passionate about,they alow me to share the music and skill I am ready to produce and present to my audience now, also featuring selected sounds to come.</p>
